<h3 align="center">Restrooms</h3>
Users do not need an account to create a restroom. Users only need to have the restroom address, name, and an optional phone number.
This also ties into the next part which is viewing restrooms. Users can utilize the search bar in the main search screen to view restrooms at a specific address. 
Users can also simply click the `View Restrooms` button to view restrooms near the users' location. 
Within this map screen, users can still utilize the search bar here to view restrooms at a specific address.
